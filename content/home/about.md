# Biography


I am a researcher/developer in distributed ledger and semantic technologies. My interests include decentralized scholarly publication, linked data and reactive programming paradigms.

I've currently accepted a job offer from Jaguar Land Rover and plan to join the team at one of JLR's principle engineering centres in February, 2019.
